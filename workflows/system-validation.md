# System Validation Workflow

## Purpose

Audit the consistency of the AI Engineering System and its client
integration without modifying files or remote services.

## 1. Resolve the Canonical Root

Determine the system root using this preference:

1. AI_ENGINEERING_HOME when configured and valid.
2. The repository root of the current working directory.
3. The resolved target of the global OpenCode AGENTS.md link.
4. $HOME/Documents/ai-engineering, only if that directory exists.

Do not assume the current working directory is the system root.

If the root cannot be established, report the missing information.

## 2. Validate the Core

Check for the existence of:

- AGENTS.md
- CLAUDE.md
- README.md
- agents/orchestrator.md
- agents/reviewer.md
- agents/auditor.md
- commands/task.md
- commands/pr.md
- commands/review-pr.md
- commands/system-check.md
- contracts/task-provider.md
- contracts/design-provider.md
- contracts/git-provider.md
- integrations/access-strategy.md
- integrations/provider-policy.md
- integrations/provider-matrix.md
- integrations/external-skill-registry.md
- workflows/task-to-code.md
- workflows/pull-request-review.md
- workflows/system-validation.md

Check that CLAUDE.md references AGENTS.md rather than duplicating
the complete shared instructions.

## 3. Validate Skills

Check that every referenced Skill exists at its canonical location.

At minimum inspect:

- discovery
- project-analysis
- stack-detection
- task-context
- design-analysis
- complexity-advisor
- architecture-advisor
- testing-strategy
- engineering-review
- git-workflow
- repository-strategy
- pull-request
- pull-request-review
- review-memory

Do not require a dedicated Next.js Skill.

Next.js must be covered by stack detection.

## 3.1 Validate External Skills

Read:

- integrations/external-skill-registry.md

For every registered external Skill, verify:

- canonical local directory exists
- SKILL.md exists and contains valid metadata
- source repository and source path are recorded
- upstream commit is recorded as a full Git commit SHA
- license identifier is recorded
- required license file exists
- supporting files referenced by SKILL.md exist
- local modifications are documented
- no conflicting internal Skill or policy is introduced

For the initially selected Skills, verify:

### frontend-design

- Path: skills/frontend-design/
- Required files: SKILL.md and LICENSE.txt
- License: Apache-2.0

### test-driven-development

- Path: skills/test-driven-development/
- Required files: SKILL.md, writing-good-tests.md, and LICENSE-MIT.txt
- License: MIT
- Verify that the local language-neutral adaptation is documented.

Possible statuses:

- VERIFIED
- NOT INSTALLED
- LICENSE MISSING
- SOURCE REVISION MISSING
- SUPPORTING FILE MISSING
- POLICY CONFLICT
- NOT VERIFIED

Never report an external Skill as VERIFIED based only on its registry entry.

Report E2E readiness as BLOCKED while a required external Skill is missing
or its license and source cannot be verified.

## License Metadata Interpretation

The registry records the canonical SPDX license identifier.

The upstream Skill frontmatter may use a license-file reference, an SPDX
identifier, or omit a license field.

Do not require the frontmatter value to match the registry SPDX identifier
literally.

For frontend-design:

- Accept the upstream metadata "Complete terms in LICENSE.txt".
- Verify that LICENSE.txt exists.
- Verify that the registry records Apache-2.0.

For test-driven-development:

- A missing license field in SKILL.md is not automatically an error.
- Verify that LICENSE-MIT.txt exists and contains the MIT license.
- Verify that the registry records MIT.

Report LICENSE METADATA INCONSISTENCY only if the metadata contradicts
the actual license evidence or points to a missing license file.

Do not modify upstream Skill metadata solely to satisfy a simplistic
string-equality check.

## 4. Validate Client Adapters

For OpenCode, inspect:

- global AGENTS.md configuration
- global command discovery
- global agent discovery
- global Skill discovery
- command descriptions
- referenced agent names
- agent frontmatter
- relevant permissions

Inspect existing paths before suggesting any link changes.

Never overwrite an existing configuration.

## 5. Validate Policies

Confirm consistency across the Core, Skills, commands, and workflows:

- Ask for the branch name before implementation when not supplied.
- Preserve uncommitted changes.
- Use the correct base branch.
- Do not create a PR or publish review comments remotely.
- Generate copy-ready PR and review content.
- Keep review workflows read-only.
- Use architecture patterns only when justified.
- Support direct URLs and local artifacts.
- Treat MCP as optional.
- Keep credentials out of version control.

## 6. Reference Integrity

Inspect references to Skills, workflows, contracts, agents, and commands.

Identify:

- referenced but missing files
- inconsistent filenames
- obsolete command names
- contradictory lifecycle instructions
- duplicate canonical instructions

Do not flag a reference as broken merely because a file is intentionally
provided by the client rather than by the canonical repository.

## 7. Provider State

Distinguish:

- supported by the architecture
- documented as a candidate
- locally configured
- successfully tested

Do not claim a provider works merely because its name appears in a table.

Do not print credentials or secret environment-variable values.

## 8. Output

Return:

### SYSTEM VALIDATION

- Canonical root:
- Client:
- Required files:
- Missing files:
- Invalid references:
- Policy contradictions:
- OpenCode discovery:
- Provider configuration status:
- License status:

### Findings

Classify:

- P0: unsafe configuration or destructive risk
- P1: core workflow broken
- P2: important inconsistency
- P3: optional improvement

### Recommended Actions

Provide the smallest changes that resolve actual findings.

## Safety

This workflow is read-only.

Never create, delete, overwrite, commit, push, or publish anything.
Never expose secrets.

Report checks as NOT VERIFIED when the available tools cannot establish
their result.
